Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible.A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept).

Respondents who report not knowing their income are not included in this table, which includes only the reference person with relatives in the household or people with the following relationship to the householder: spouse, child, grandchild, parent, sibling, or other relative. This table excludes foster children, unmarried partners, non-relatives, and roommates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
