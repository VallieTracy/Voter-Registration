NOTES:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Federal surveys now give respondents the option of reporting more than one race.  Therefore, two basic ways of defining a race group are possible.A group such as Asian may be defined as those who reported Asian and no other race (the race-alone or single-race concept) or as those who reported Asian regardless of whether they also reported another race (the race-alone-or-in-combination concept).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Family income is limited to persons who report income or refuse to answer the income question. Respondents who report not knowing their income are not included in this table, which includes only the reference person with relatives in the household or people with the following relationship to the householder: spouse, child, grandchild, parent, sibling, or other relative. This table excludes foster children, unmarried partners, non-relatives, and roommates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total Figure is the number of registered citizens who reported not voting. If a respondent answered Don't Know or Refused to either the Voting or Registration question they were not included in this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
